the ISO is compiled for i686 and is a "live CD" so you can try out 
GoboLinux without actually installing it, so you have no

</p><p>
For those who haven't kept up with the mailing
list, the GoboLinux hierarchy is going through a series of small but
important improvements. /System/Links/Environment centralizes
environment variable configurations. /System/Links/Daemons controls
daemons using
<a href="http://smarden.org/runit/dependencies.html">RunIt</a>.
/Programs/Foo/1.0/Defaults stores the app's default settings.
Each program can also keep and pack its own /System/Variable entries.
To use these features you need to upgrade the Scripts package.
</p><p>
Last but not the least, a number of packages are popping up on the
repositories. Keep an eye on the "Latest Packages" sidebar!

After some weeks of intensive work, GoboLinux 007 final 
 is available for download (<a href="?page=downloads">download it!</a>).
Since 006, there were major improvements all over the system, including the 
funcionality required to pack "Environment", "Daemons" and "Default Settings" 
information within packages (using the "Resources" directory). The LiveCD 
experience was also 
severely improved: now you can run even KDE and OpenOffice without touching
your hard disk. With the use of IsoLinux, most (maybe all) of the compatibility 
problems experienced when trying to boot the 006 CD on certain machines are solved.
</p>
<p>
If you have a GoboLinux 006 running, you don't need to reinstall it. Use

review </a>of GoboLinux, based on version 012. 
</p>   
<p>   
<i>"One major problem with the Linux world is the overwhelming number of   
redundant distributions, especially in the desktop-oriented area. It's rare to   
see a new distribution that isn't a Debian or Red Hat clone in disguise with   
an extra feature or two, or that dares to take a bold departure from the   
status quo. One of those rarities, however, is GoboLinux."</i>   
</p>   
<p>   
<i>"I was impressed by the way GoboLinux handled. This distribution clearly   
has a well-defined identity of its own, and the authors' philosophy shows in   
every detail of the system. The system is fast, without a grain of bloat in   
it."</i>

<p>
We are pleased to introduce <b>GoboLinux 013</b>, the new major release of
GoboLinux, the alternative Linux distribution. This release is the
result of over an year of work on the build infrastructure used by
the distribution. The new Live CD build environment is highly
<a href="?page=livecd">customizable</a> and package building was overhauled
by using a dynamically-generated sandboxed environment which insulates
the source code and its dependencies during compilation.
</p>

<p>
These under-the-hood improvements resulted in cleaner builds when
bringing the package set up-to-date: major upgrades include Xorg 7.1,
KDE 3.5.3, Glibc 2.4 and GCC 4.1.1. This release also features a number
of improvements in the management tools, particularly new versions of <a href="?page=manager">Manager</a>, the graphical management console, and
<a href="?page=compile">Compile</a>, the GoboLinux package building tool.

Among other things, it includes a massive update of packages, including Glibc 2.5, Xorg 7.2, GCC 4.1.2 and KDE 3.5.6, with Linux 2.6.20.4 + UTF-8 support. We have now, also, a better printing support, with a few basic drivers included in the LiveCD. And there were many, many bug fixes in the
GoboLinux tools since 013, so we hope to provide a better experience for you all. <a href="http://lists.gobolinux.org/pipermail/gobolinux-users/2007-April/005101.html">Click here</a> for information on download instructions and for the full package list.

The wallpaper for the LiveCD desktop has endured many releases and served very well through all these years giving 
that extra spice of quirkyness to this already unconventional distro, but as all things come to an end, it is time to retire 
it. What will take the place of the mysterious penguin feet? It's up to you to come up with. Yes, it's a wallpaper contest

<p>It has been a while since last news post, but that doesn't mean that development has stopped or even stagnated. A lot has happened under the surface and those that follow mailing lists, forums, hang out in IRC or just subscribe to the recipe RSS feed can see that we have not been lazy. What can be said is that we could use more manpower to move faster, because there is no lack of ideas or goals within the project.
Besides that our tools are always evolving, we now have a simple but powerful use flag implementation and with a new simpler recipe API coming in next release, our package/recipe repository is continuously growing and is kept up to date, with for example KDE 4.2.0 and GCC 4.3.3.</p>

<p>To get more continuity in our communication and to get better information flow to our users and fans we have finally started a <a href="http://blog.gobolinux.org">blog</a>. Here we will make small (and sometimes big) notes, that do not warrant their own news post, about what is currently happening within development of GoboLinux.</p>

<p>
Ten years of commits, from CVS, to Subversion, and now to Git: we're happy to announce <a href="http://github.com/gobolinux">github.com/gobolinux</a>.
</p>

<center><img src="<<root>>/images/que_octocat.png"/></center>

<p>
The entire history of commits has been preserved. We tried our best to convert tags, but due to inconsistencies in the format of the tags/ repository over time (perhaps due to CVS→Subversion conversions), not all were saved. Still, most recent releases for Scripts and Compile are properly tagged, though.
</p>
<p>
There is still work to do: the scripts themselves still need to be converted to point to the new infrastructure. The GitHub repositories will be also cloned at the <a href="http://gobolinux.org">gobolinux.org</a> infrastructure as a backup, but primary development should happen there. Yes, that means pull requests are welcome!

The next release of GoboLinux is under active development. As in the last release, we are using <a href="https://github.com/gobolinux/GoboALFS">GoboALFS</a>, a collection of build scripts based on <a href="http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/alfs/">Automated Linux From Scratch</a> and our own <a href="https://github.com/gobolinux/Recipes">Compile recipes tree</a>. The main focus of this next release is designing a very lean core system with updated packages, including 64-bit support.

After a long downtime, the GoboLinux wiki is back!

As part of our move to the <a href="http://github.com/gobolinux/">GitHub 
infrastructure</a>, we have imported the contents of the old MediaWiki installation into 
the wiki feature of GitHub. The material is now available (and editable!) at <a 
href="http://github.com/gobolinux/Documentation/wiki">the wiki for the Documentation 
repository</a>.

While there is plenty of useful stuff there, there is also lots of material that are 
currently outdated. Help cleaning it up is most welcome — it's a wiki, <a 
href="http://wiki.gobolinux.org">so join in</a>!

<p>
We are happy to announce the first preview of GoboLinux 016, the distro's first 64-bit 
release since its creation back in 2002. Some of the highlights include:
</p>
<ul>
<li> Runner, our filesystem virtualization tool that dynamically changes the processes' 
view 
of /System/Index based on the program's Dependencies file. With that tool, one does not 
need to worry about which version of a given dependency is currently linked (or activated) 
on /System/Index;</li>
<li> A minimalistic desktop based on the Awesome window manager;</li>
<li> A focus on the exploration of novel ideas. You may find this snapshot less packed 
with packages, but it should be more fun to run!</li>
</ul>
<p>
We have worked hard to ensure it runs smoothly on a variety of machines, but given the 
architecture switch it is possible that we forgot something. We will collect reports from 
you for a few weeks before rolling a new snapshot of what'll soon become 016 final.<br>
</p><p>
Here's the <a href="http://gobolinux.org/iso/GoboLinux-016-alpha.iso.torrent">Torrent 
link</a>. 
We hope you enjoy 
it!</p>

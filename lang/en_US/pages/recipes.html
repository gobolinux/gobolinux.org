<h1>Recipes</h1>

Before building and installing software, it must be
configured to suit the OS directory structure. That is why
each Linux distribution has its own packaging system and own
configuration rules. 

GoboLinux has an unorthodox directory layout, and programs
may need some persuasion to install files in the correct
locations. 

Program can either be configured to use the Gobo install
directories, or as a fallback they can use the legacy
directories (/usr, /bin, /var, /etc) that Gobo provides for
compatibility.

Usually you won't have to deal with these issues. GoboLinux
has compilation rules called <a

recipes</a> for thousands of programs. These recipes are
used by the <a href="?page=compile">Compile</a> program to
build software for GoboLinux.  </p>

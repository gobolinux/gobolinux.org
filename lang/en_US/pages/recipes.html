<h1>Recipes</h1>

<p>
In the free software world, compiling programs from source is commonplace. As
you might expect, the vast majority of programs don't ship configured by
default to use the GoboLinux directory hierarchy... though most are quite
happy to use it. Those that aren't can be persuaded -- as a last resort,
there's always the compatibility "legacy" directories. Most of the time, you
won't have to deal with it, though: compilation rules for hundreds of programs
are already automated in the <a href="?page=compile">Compile</a> program and
its "recipes" tree.

We keep the <a href="https://github.com/gobolinux/Recipes">repository of
GoboLinux recipes on Github</a>.

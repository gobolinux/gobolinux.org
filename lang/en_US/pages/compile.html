<h1>     
Compile: the GoboLinux compilation system     
</h1>

<p>
<b>Compile</b> downloads source tarballs, unpacks, compiles and installs
them, with a single command, using simple compilation scripts called
"recipes". <b>Compile</b> was introduced in GoboLinux 011, but already
features a considerable (and ever-growing) number of recipes, and
is able to compile all kinds of software, including Glibc,
GCC, KDE and the Linux kernel.
</p>
     
<p>     
Some of <b>Compile</b>'s distinctive features:     
</p>     
     
<ul>     
<li>     
<span class="hilite">uses the each project's own download site to fetch sources</span>: 
the GoboLinux repository (or one of its mirrors) is used for downloading recipes
only. Recipes can be downloaded explicitly, using the GetRecipe
command, or on-the-fly by Compile, when a compilation is requested.
</li>     
<li>     
<span class="hilite">minimalistic and declarative-oriented compilation scripts</span>: typical "configure;
make; make install" software can be scripted in two lines, greatly easing maintanance.     
</li>     
<li>     
<span class="hilite">supports GoboLinux-style dependencies</span>: when matching dependencies for
a compilation, Compile looks directly into /Programs. No matter how
the package was installed -- by a binary package using InstallPackage,
compiled from source using Compile, or even compiled by hand by the
user -- it can be used by Compile when satisfying dependencies.     
</li>     
<li>     
<span class="hilite">path-agnostic by design</span>: also works in a Rootless-GoboLinux installation, ie,     
inside a $HOME directory of any other distribution.     
</li>     
</ul>

<h3>Using Compile</h3>     
     
As a user, all you need to do is ask <b>Compile</b> to compile your software:     

<div class="console"><div class="padding"><pre>
Compile allegro
</pre></div></div>
     
It will search for an available recipe (doing a case-insensitive search) and     
do all the work for you.     
     
As a potential contributor, you will find Recipes <i>very</i> easy to     
create. In fact, ease of maintenance was the #1 concern (given that we     
are still a niche distribution and have limited resources).     
     
A real example. This is how a Recipe file for a typical autoconf-based     
program looks like. Two lines, nothing more:     
     
<div class="textfile"><pre>
url=$ftpGnu/gtypist/gtypist-2.7.tar.bz2     
recipe_type=configure   
</pre></div>
     
A more complex example: Zip uses only makefiles. <b>Compile</b> supports     
it just as well.     
     
<div class="textfile"><pre>
url=ftp.uu.net/pub/archiving/zip/src/zip23.tar.gz     
recipe_type=makefile  
dir=zip-2.3     
makefile=unix/Makefile     
build_target=generic_gcc     
install_variables=(     
   "prefix=$target"     
)     
</pre></div>

<h3>Contributing Recipes</h3>     
     
<p>     
To send your own recipes, simply run the <tt>ContributeRecipe</tt> command after a successful build!
Your contributions are greatly appreciated by the GoboLinux community! (Be sure to     
put your name in your <tt>Compile.conf</tt> file so that <tt>MakeRecipe</tt> credits     
you as the author in the recipe!)

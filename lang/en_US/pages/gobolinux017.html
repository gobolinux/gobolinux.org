<h1>Introducing GoboLinux 017</h1>

<h2>An exercise in software design freedom</h2>

<p>GoboLinux was created out of a desire to try new approaches in the
Linux distribution design space: the <a href="?page=at_a_glance">innovative
filesystem organization</a> allows us to use a radically different 
approach in package management — effectively doing away with
the package manager.</p>

<p>GoboLinux 017 continues this journey. One of the principles of software
freedom is the ability to modify and customize. Software isn't truly free
if you need to rely on third-parties to integrate it for you. As Linux
distributions get more and more complicated, GoboLinux asks this question:
can a Linux system still be built from scratch by a small team — and most
importantly, customized in non-trivial ways — and remain understandable
by a single person?</p>

<p>The GoboLinux structure allows you to see how every building block of a
Linux system is composed, and installs every package in a way for which they
were never originally designed. The longevity of the GoboLinux project, 18
years in the making, puts the promise of free and open source software to the
test, and continues to deliver.</p>

<h2>Simplified compilation recipe management</h2>

<p>
This release introduces a simplified model for recipe management and
contribution that's fully integrated with the Compile build tool.
</p>

<p>The recipe tree is now a plain Git repository managed via GitHub
cloned into your <tt>/Data/Compile/Recipes</tt> directory and used 
by the GoboLinux Compile tool directly.</p>

<p>Just like the Mac Homebrew project was inspired by GoboLinux in its
inception, we now take a page back from Homebrew and move our recipe
management model into becoming Git-centric, managed at <a href="https://github.com/gobolinux/Recipes">GitHub</a>.<p>

<h3>Contributing is easier than ever</h3>

<p>The existing <tt>ContributeRecipe</tt> tool, which used to package a
recipe file and upload to the GoboLinux.org servers for review, now branches
your local clone, commits your new recipe, and pushes it to your fork
of the Recipes tree on GitHub.
</p>

<p>This should make it easier for the GoboLinux community to contribute
recipes to the tree: we are looking forward to receiving your pull
requests!</p>

<h2>An Awesome desktop</h2>

<p>GoboLinux 017 continues to feature a minimalistic yet comfortable desktop
based on the Awesome window manager. Awesome is well-known as an excellent
tiling WM, but its Lua scripting capabilities makes it extremely customizable.
In Gobo, we tuned it so it ships with a setup based on floating windows which
should be familiar to all users, while keeping all the power features of
Awesome at hand.</p>

<h3>What's new</h3>

<p>The desktop in 017 extends that of 016. We continue to include our custom
widgets for Wi-Fi, audio (now using PulseAudio), battery status, laptop
backlight, and we now bundle a new Bluetooth widget and screenshot functionality.</p>

<p>And of course, there's a new procedurally-generated wallpaper, which you'll
have to boot into the Live ISO to check out! ; )</p>

<h2>Hardware and software updates</h2>

<p>
This release also features updates on the hardware and software sides
of things: kernel and driver updates ensure that more recent hardware
are well-supported, and an overarching system update ensured a total
revamp of the software dependencies, doing away with a bunch of legacy
software.
</p>

<h3>Out with the old, in with the new</h3>

<p>
It's 2020, and this means Python 2 is no more! GoboLinux uses quite
a bit of Python in its infrastructure, and we are happy to report that
not only all of it was converted to Python 3, but Python 2 was entirely
removed from the system. While we were on this cleaning spree, we also
got rid of some other legacy packages:
<p/>

<ul>
<li>GTK+ 2 is no longer included, only GTK+ 3 packages are shipped
in the ISO
</li><li>
The graphical installer now uses Qt 5
</li><li>
On the terminal side, the latest NCurses is built only with
wide-character support (libncursesw6.so) - the ASCII-only
libncurses.so is no more.
</li><li>
Audio management now uses PulseAudio. Recent versions of PulseAudio
are now quite stable and are able to provide a seamless user experience
across multiple audio devices.
</li>

</ul>

<p>
Of course, users are free to compile and install any version of any
library they wish, and have them coexist nicely in the system thanks to
<a href="?page=runner">Runner</a>, GoboLinux's innovative lightweight
filesystem virtualizer. But since GoboLinux has always been a forward-looking
distro, we chose to provide a pristine base environment with only the
latest libraries and no legacy cruft.

GoboLinux wouldn't be where it is today if it wasn't for all the <a href="?page=devteam">developers</a>
that worked on it over the years and the many users who submitted package <a href="https://github.com/gobolinux/Recipes">recipes</a>.

<p>
We'd also like to give special thanks to our community for their continued support
over the years, and all feedback received on 017 pre-releases!

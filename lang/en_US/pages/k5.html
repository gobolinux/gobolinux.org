<h1>The Unix tree rethought: an introduction to GoboLinux</h1>

<p><i>Hisham Muhammad, May 09 2003.</i></p>

<p>

Lately, there has been lots of discussion on the current state of Linux
as a desktop system, and articles pop up <a
href="http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2003/2/23/115919/628">here</a> and 
there, occasionally with very good ideas. However, none
have surprised me more than <a
href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=03/04/29/1958212&mode=thread">this
one</a>. It was all very hyphothetical, but had pretty radical ideas on
how the thought the Linux directory tree should be reorganized. This was
clearly the most polemical part of the article, and raised many
discussions whether something like this could actually be implemented.
And that's the reason for my surprise: we had this implemented for over
an year. <a href="http://www.gobolinux.org">GoboLinux</a> is a Linux
distribution based on an alternative directory tree, which has evolved
from a custom <a href="http://www.linuxfromscratch.org">LFS</a>
installation to a distro that's used and maintained by a small group of
people today. It was interesting to see that there's a lot of people
interested in ideas similar to ours. So, maybe it's time for us to come
out of the shadows.

A bit of history

</b></p><p>

We all remember the time when talking about Linux distributions for the
desktop meant arguing which has the best installer. Much has evolved
since: the easy, graphical installers are here, but we're <a
href="http://www.linuxworld.com/2003/0401.tsu.html">not quite there
yet</a>. Among the usual rants on "why (insert pet peeve here) is the
problem", some interesting ideas come up from time to time. More 
interestingly, some people started to believe maybe it's time for more
adventurous attempts.

</p><p>

Oddly, GoboLinux did not start as one of those. The whole thing started
when I had to install programs at the University.  As I had no write
access to the standard Unix directories, I created my own directories
under <tt>$HOME</tt> the way I saw fit. I upgraded the programs from
source constantly, and couldn't use a package manager. My solution was
the most obvious one: to place each program in its own directory, such
as <tt>~/Programs/AfterStep</tt>. Soon the environment variables
(<tt>PATH</tt>, <tt>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</tt>...) got bigger and bigger, so I
created centralized directories for each class of files, containing
symbolic links: <tt>~/Libraries</tt>, <tt>~/Headers</tt> and so on. A
natural evolution was to write shell scripts to handle the links,
<tt>configure</tt>s and <tt>Makefiles</tt>. 

</p><p>

This system proved itself to be very convenient to use. At my home
system, I started to gradually remove pre-compiled packages and
recompile them with those scripts. I was moving towards a completely
custom Linux system, which I jokingly called LodeLinux. When I had it
about 80% complete, the Great Filesystem Crash struck. It was time to
start it all over again, but this time through a different route:
instead of "deconstructing" an existing distribution, me ( <a
href="http://cscience.org/~lode">Hisham Muhammad</a>) and a friend, <a
href="http://cscience.org/~detsch">André Detsch</a>, spent two
days building a modified <a href="http://www.linuxfromscratch.org">Linux
From Scratch</a> system. Without much fuss, on March 20, 2002, GoboLinux
was born. A month later, we presented an article at the  <a
href="http://www.cpad.pucrs.br/wsl2002/">3rd. Workshop on Free
Software</a> called "A new proposal for the Unix directory tree". 

</p><p><b>

What is it all about?

</b></p><p>

GoboLinux is definitely <b>not</b> "yet another Linux distro for the
desktop". It is entirely based on an alternative directory structure.
Every program lives in its own directory: you'll find XFree86 4.3 at
<tt>/Programs/XFree86/4.3/</tt>, and <tt>ping</tt> at
<tt>/Programs/Netkit-Base/0.17/bin/ping</tt>. To see what programs
are installed in the system, all you need to do is <tt>ls /Programs</tt>.

</p><p>

For each category of files, there is a directory under
<tt>/System/Links</tt> grouping files from each application as symbolic
links: <tt>Executables</tt>, <tt>Libraries</tt>, <tt>Headers</tt>,
<tt>Shared</tt> and <tt>Manuals</tt>. For compatibility, each "legacy"
directory is a link to a corresponding category. Therefore, <tt>/bin</tt>,
<tt>/sbin</tt>, <tt>/usr/bin</tt>, <tt>/usr/local/bin</tt> (and so on) are
all symlinks to <tt>/System/Links/Executables</tt>. Environment variables
are also simplified: <tt>export PATH=/System/Links/Executables</tt> is
enough.

</p><p>

In short, what he have is a database-less package management system:
the directory structure itself organizes the system (wasn't that its
original purpose, after all?). Each program directory (for example,
<tt>/Programs/KDE</tt>) holds version directories (<tt>/Programs/KDE/3.0</tt>,
<tt>/Programs/KDE/3.1.1</tt>), and a version-neutral directory for
settings (<tt>/Programs/KDE/Settings</tt>), to keep files that would
normally be in <tt>/etc</tt>. Keeping two or more versions of a library
is trivial. When most distributions switched to GCC 3 they released a
new major version, mostly incompatible with previous ones. When the 006
series of GoboLinux adopted GCC 3, it was just a matter of keeping old
versions of libraries alongside the new ones, while they were gradually
phased out. No "compat" packages involved.

</p><p>

Most tasks in GoboLinux are automated by a collection of scripts. To
create a GoboLinux package, just type something like <tt>CreatePackage
CoreUtils</tt>. All this command does is storing <tt>CoreUtils/5.0/</tt>
and <tt>CoreUtils/Settings</tt> in a .tar.bz2 file called
<tt>CoreUtils--5.0--i686.tar.bz2</tt>. A link called 
<tt>/Programs/CoreUtils/Current</tt> indicates which version is
currently in effect. This is used by the scripts as a 'default version'.
Installation of a program is handle by three scripts:
<tt>PrepareProgram</tt>, which creates the
<tt>/Program/</tt><program-name> hierarchy and passes the proper
options to <tt>configure</tt>. <tt>SymlinkProgram</tt> creates the
links at <tt>/System/Links</tt>. A wrapper script, <tt>CompileProgram</tt>
covers the common <tt>configure && make && make install</tt> case (with
a number of command-line options to handle special cases).

</p><p><b>

Alternative boot scripts

</b></p><p>

Since we felt like we were "starting from scratch" and we really wanted
to make a system where everything just made sense for us, we also took
the time to rethink the boot scripts. I felt the two historical models
(System V and BSD) were overkill for our common desktop-machine setup.
GoboLinux uses a simpler system: two scripts, <tt>Init</tt> and <tt>Done</tt>,
do most of the job. Additional scripts, such as <tt>Multi</tt> and 
<tt>Single</tt>, take care of the runlevels. These files are simply
sequences of commands, prepended by the word <tt>Exec</tt> and a message
string. Here's an excerpt of <tt>Init</tt>:

</p><pre>
Exec "Setting clock..." SetClock
Exec "Loading keymap..." loadkeys "$KeymapLayout"
Exec "Bringing up the loopback interface..." ifconfig lo 127.0.0.1
</pre><p>

More elaborate tasks such as <tt>SetClock</tt> are defined as shell
functions in a <tt>Tasks</tt> file (these tasks can also be called from
the command-line using the <tt>RunTask</tt> script). Configurable
settings are defined as environment variables in the <tt>Options</tt>
file. The wrapper function <tt>Exec</tt> allows for a nifty additional
feature: boot themes. The boot sequence can look Slackware-like (with
the standard error/output messages), RedHat-like (with lots of OK's), or
<a href="">GoboLinux-like</a> (the latter uses a modified version of the
<a href="http://lpp-themes.sourceforge.net/">Linux Progress Patch</a>).

</p><p><b>

The "legacy" tree

</b></p><p>

Unfortunately, not all programs have the flexibility to be installed
anywhere. Occasionally, hardcoded paths creep in even in programs that
belong to userland, and should, at least theoretically, allow themselves
to be installed inside, say, a user's home directory.

</p><p>

As much as I'd like to see this done in the long term, patching all
applications is not an option. For this reason, GoboLinux keeps, as
stated earlier, a legacy tree where all usual Unix paths are mapped to
GoboLinux equivalents, so, if a <tt>Makefile</tt> looks for
<tt>/usr/X11R6/include/X11/Xaw3d/XawInit.h</tt>, it will find it, 
although it is at 
<tt>/Programs/Xaw3d/1.5/include/X11/Xaw3d/XawInit.h</tt>, where it
belongs. When two applications have a directory entry with the same
name, the GoboLinux scripts recursively expand them. Both XFree86 and
Xaw3d have <tt>X11</tt> under <tt>include</tt>. A directory
<tt>/System/Links/Headers/X11</tt> is created automatically, holding
links from both <tt>X11</tt> directories.

</p><p>

Another interesting feature is that the GoboLinux scripts execute
<tt>make install</tt> using a special user id that only has write
permissions inside the program's source directories and the program's
entry under <tt>/Programs</tt>. This way, files can't "escape" from
the GoboLinux hierarchy and slip directory into the legacy tree.

</p><p>

The GoboLinux directory structure brings a fresh, clean look the Linux
system, but the presence of the legacy tree, while necessary, takes some
of this beauty away. Mac OS X uses a "dirty trick" to cover up its Unix
nature: the Finder won't show the Unix directories, but you can see them
from the command line. In Linux we have many different ways for looking
at the filesystem (shells, file managers, browsers...), so we had to go
deeper to have a cleanly-looking system. GoboHide is a (obviously
optional) kernel patch plus userland application written by <a
href="http://cscience.org/~lucasvr">Lucas Correia Villa Real</a> and
Felipe Damásio that effectively implements "hidden files" on
Linux (way beyond dot-files, which are implemented on UI-level just like
Finder does).

<p>
Here's what <tt>ls /</tt> looks like on GoboLinux:

<pre>
Depot  Mount     System
Files  Programs  Users

Related work

As you read this, you have probably found many familiar concepts (not to
mention directory names). GoboLinux has clearly found inspiration in
other operating systems, like Mac OS X, BeOS and <a
href="http://www.atheos.cx">AtheOS</a>, but I think that the notion that
they build "something different" using an existing Unix base (be it
using a Unix kernel as in OS X or using GNU tools as in AtheOS) was the
most important influence of all. Right now there are several other
projects, in various stages of development, that use the Linux Kernel as
a foundation and feature alternative directory trees. Interestingly,
most of them are clones or heavily inspired by a specific proprietary 
operating system: <a
href="http://lemmit.kaplinski.com/home/green/Linux/">ROX OS</a> intends
to be a RiscOS-like system, <a
href="http://www.linuxstep.org/">LinuxSTEP</a> is a project based on
GNUstep aiming for a NeXT-like system, and <a
href="http://www.blueeyedos.com/">BlueEyedOS</a> aims for a
source-level-compatible BeOS clone.

</p><p>

GoboLinux, on the other hand, is not a clone of anything else. It uses
standard Linux desktop software. We believe that the well-organized
directory structure makes it a good testbed for new ideas -- possibilities
are wide open.

</p><p><b>

Where are we now?

</b></p><p>

<p>

GoboLinux has evolved immensely during the last year. At <a
href="http://www.gobolinux.org">gobolinux.org</a> you can find an ISO
image of our latest release, 006. It's a bootable "live CD" running
GoboLinux in a chrooted read-only filesystem, so you can walk around the
directory structure and have a peek on how GoboLinux feels like. The CD
also features the usual installer scripts and extra packages. There's no
flashy graphical installer yet, but I think the ease-of-use of the
installation reflects the overal ease-of-use of the system as a whole
(unlike it happens on many distributions).

</p><p>

Despite of the very small userbase (we have never really announced it
anywhere yet), the project has progressed quickly and has been fully
usable for quite a while right now (most GoboLinux developers use it
as their only operating system, and a few others do so, too).

    <b>GoboLinux</b> is an experimental Linux distribution that<br>
    <b>Redefines</b> the entire filesystem hierarchy.

<p>
    In GoboLinux you don't need a package database, because<br>
    the <b>Filesystem is the database</b>: each program resides in its own directory.<br>
    Such as <b>/Programs/Nano/8.3</b> or <b>/Programs/GCC/14.2.0</b>. Like it? <a href="at_a_glance.html">Learn more...</a>
